### **Aurora Writes Only Redo Log Records, Reducing Data Page Writes**
Amazon **Aurora's storage architecture** is fundamentally different from traditional **PostgreSQL on RDS**. The key difference is **how it handles writes**.

---

## **Traditional PostgreSQL (RDS) Write Process**
1. When you **INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE** data:
   - PostgreSQL writes changes to **both**:
     - **Write-Ahead Log (WAL)** (for durability and crash recovery).
     - **Data Pages** in the **data directory** (eventually written to disk).
   - Changes in **shared_buffers** (PostgreSQL memory cache) are periodically flushed to disk during:
     - **Checkpoints**
     - **Background writer process**
2. **Checkpoints** force all dirty pages (modified but not written) to be **flushed to disk**.
   - This process causes **high I/O spikes** and **increases disk latency**.

### **Downside of Traditional PostgreSQL:**
- **Two writes for every change** (one to WAL and another to data pages).
- **Checkpoints cause I/O spikes**.
- **Frequent disk writes increase storage costs and latency**.

---

## **Aurora's Storage Model: Redo Log-Only Writes**
Instead of writing **both WAL and data pages**, **Aurora writes only a "redo log"** and reconstructs data pages dynamically when needed.

### **How Aurora Writes Work:**
1. **User Transaction**
   - A client performs an **INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE**.
   - Instead of modifying the database page and writing it back to disk, Aurora **only records a redo log entry**.
   
2. **Aurora Log Record (Redo Log)**
   - The redo log **contains the change information**, not the actual data page.
   - Aurora stores **multiple copies** (across 6 storage nodes in 3 Availability Zones).
   - Aurora commits the change once **4 out of 6 copies confirm the write**.
   
3. **No Immediate Data Page Writes**
   - Since **only the redo log** is written, Aurora **avoids frequent page writes**.
   - Pages are **rebuilt on-demand from the redo log** when needed for queries.

4. **Read Operations and Page Construction**
   - If a query requests data that is not in memory, Aurora **fetches the latest version by replaying the redo log**.
   - This reduces storage I/O overhead significantly.

---

### **Why This Matters**
- **Fewer writes** â†’ Lower I/O latency and **reduced disk I/O**.
- **No traditional checkpoints** â†’ Avoids the **I/O spikes** seen in RDS PostgreSQL.
- **Better scaling** â†’ Aurora can handle **high-throughput workloads** efficiently.

### **Trade-Offs of Aurora's Approach**
| Feature | Traditional PostgreSQL (RDS) | Aurora |
|---------|-----------------------------|--------|
| **Write Process** | Writes to both WAL and data pages | Writes only to **redo log** |
| **Checkpoints** | Required for crash recovery | No checkpoints needed |
| **Data Page Writes** | Frequent due to dirty page flushing | Rebuilt on demand using redo logs |
| **I/O Costs** | Higher due to **extra data page writes** | Lower because **only redo logs are written** |
| **Read Latency** | Lower for frequently accessed data | Can be slower if redo logs need to be replayed |

---

### **Best Practices for Aurora**
- **Turn off synchronous commit for non-critical writes** to **reduce write latency**.
- **Optimize queries** to reduce **redo log replay overhead**.
- **Monitor I/O costs** since Aurora charges based on **log writes and data reads**.

---

### **Summary**
- **Aurora avoids writing full data pages** by **storing only redo logs**.
- This **reduces write amplification** and **lowers storage I/O costs**.
- It **eliminates checkpoints**, preventing **I/O spikes**.
- **However, reads may require reconstructing pages**, impacting query latency if not optimized.
