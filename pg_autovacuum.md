 **PostgreSQL’s autovacuum process**

---

## **1. Why Autovacuum is Essential**
PostgreSQL uses a **Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC)** model, which means old row versions (tuples) persist after updates and deletes. Without vacuuming:
- **Table bloat increases**, leading to inefficient disk usage.
- **Performance degrades** because queries must scan more data.
- **Transaction ID wraparound risk** occurs, which can cause **data corruption** if not addressed.

**Autovacuum's Three Main Goals:**
1. **Prevent Table Bloat** – Frees up dead tuples to reuse storage space.
2. **Prevent Transaction ID Wraparound** – Ensures PostgreSQL does not run out of transaction IDs.
3. **Improve Query Performance** – Updates the **visibility map** for more efficient index-only scans.

---

## **2. Understanding Table Bloat and Tuple Storage**
- PostgreSQL **does not overwrite rows** in place. Instead, updates and deletes create **dead tuples**, which need to be cleaned up.
- If dead tuples are not removed, **tables grow unnecessarily**, leading to **higher I/O and slow queries**.
- **Autovacuum helps reclaim space**, but it does not **shrink the table size** unless you use **`pg_repack`** or `VACUUM FULL`.

---

## **3. Transaction ID Wraparound and Freezing**
PostgreSQL assigns a **32-bit transaction ID (XID)** to every row version. Since it’s a finite number (4 billion values), wraparound must be prevented by:
- **Vacuum freezing** old tuples so they don’t need a transaction ID check.
- Autovacuum **aggressively vacuuming tables** before they reach the **2 billion transaction ID limit**.

Failing to vacuum results in **PostgreSQL shutting down the database to prevent data corruption**.

---

## **4. Autovacuum Scheduling and Performance Tuning**
Autovacuum works by launching background workers that vacuum tables based on:
- **Threshold-based triggers** (based on changes to a table).
- **Transaction ID age** (anti-wraparound protection).

### **Tuning Autovacuum**
1. **Adjust Thresholds for Large Tables:**
   - The default **autovacuum scale factor** is **0.2 (20%)**, meaning vacuum triggers when **20% of rows** change.
   - For large tables, **use a fixed threshold instead of a percentage** (`autovacuum_vacuum_threshold`).

2. **Increase Autovacuum Workers:**
   - Default: **3 workers**
   - Increase if you have **many tables or large databases** (`autovacuum_max_workers`).

3. **Reduce Autovacuum Cost Delay:**
   - **Older PostgreSQL versions (pre-12) had conservative settings** that made autovacuum too slow.
   - Set `autovacuum_cost_delay = 2ms` (default is 20ms in older versions).
   - Increase `autovacuum_cost_limit` to **allow more work per cycle**.

4. **Enable Logging for Debugging:**
   - `log_autovacuum_min_duration = 0` logs every autovacuum execution.

---

## **5. Cloud Considerations (Amazon RDS, Aurora, Google Cloud SQL)**
Managed PostgreSQL services have **custom autovacuum tuning**:
- **Amazon RDS/Aurora**:
  - **Adaptive autovacuum** kicks in when **500 million transactions are reached**.
  - Defaults to **higher autovacuum resource usage** than on-prem PostgreSQL.
  - **Aurora changes autovacuum cost parameters** (`cost_page_miss = 0`, `cost_delay = 500ms`).

- **Google Cloud SQL / AlloyDB**:
  - **Automatic scaling of autovacuum workers**.
  - **Transaction throttling** is applied when nearing wraparound issues.

---

## **6. Fixing Severe Table Bloat**
1. **Regular Autovacuuming** prevents excessive bloat.
2. **For heavily bloated tables**, use **`pg_repack`** instead of `VACUUM FULL` to reclaim space **without downtime**.
3. **Monitor bloat using** `pgstattuple` or bloat estimation queries.

---

## **Final Thoughts**
- **Autovacuum is crucial for PostgreSQL performance.**
- **Tuning settings per table** can greatly **reduce bloat and improve query speed**.
- **Cloud environments require additional considerations** as managed services modify PostgreSQL behavior.

Here are some **SQL queries and scripts** for **monitoring bloat and tuning autovacuum** in **PostgreSQL**:

---

## **1. Monitor Table Bloat Using `pgstattuple`**
PostgreSQL’s `pgstattuple` extension provides **bloat information** about tables.

### **Install the Extension (if not already installed)**
```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pgstattuple;
```

### **Check Table Bloat**
```sql
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    relname AS table_name,
    pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size(relid)) AS total_size,
    pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size(relid)) AS table_size,
    pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size(relid) - pg_relation_size(relid)) AS index_size,
    (pgstattuple(relid)).dead_tuple_count AS dead_tuples,
    ROUND((pgstattuple(relid)).dead_tuple_percent, 2) AS dead_tuple_pct
FROM pg_stat_user_tables 
ORDER BY dead_tuple_pct DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
**Interpretation:**
- If **dead_tuple_pct > 10%**, you may need **more frequent autovacuum**.
- If a table has **a high number of dead tuples and is large**, consider **manual vacuuming or repacking**.

---

## **2. Identify Tables Needing Autovacuum Tuning**
```sql
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    relname AS table_name,
    n_live_tup AS live_tuples,
    n_dead_tup AS dead_tuples,
    last_vacuum,
    last_autovacuum,
    autovacuum_count
FROM pg_stat_user_tables 
ORDER BY n_dead_tup DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
**Interpretation:**
- If `n_dead_tup` is high but `last_autovacuum` is **NULL or outdated**, increase autovacuum frequency.
- `autovacuum_count` shows how often autovacuum has run.

---

## **3. Check Autovacuum Activity in Real Time**
```sql
SELECT 
    pid, age(now(), backend_start) AS running_time, 
    query, state 
FROM pg_stat_activity 
WHERE query LIKE '%VACUUM%'
ORDER BY running_time DESC;
```
**Interpretation:**
- Shows active **vacuum processes** and how long they’ve been running.

---

## **4. Adjust Autovacuum Settings for Large Tables**
For large tables, set **fixed thresholds** instead of percentage-based scaling.

```sql
ALTER TABLE my_large_table
SET (autovacuum_vacuum_threshold = 50000, autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor = 0);
```
**Why?**
- Default `autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor = 0.2` (20% of table size) is **too high** for large tables.
- **Instead, trigger vacuum at a fixed number** (e.g., `50,000` changes).

---

## **5. Speed Up Autovacuum by Reducing Cost Delay**
```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay = 2;
ALTER SYSTEM SET autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit = 2000;
SELECT pg_reload_conf();
```
**Why?**
- **Reduces delay between vacuum operations** (default `20ms` → `2ms`).
- **Increases the work vacuum can do per cycle** (default `200` → `2000`).

---

## **6. Force an Immediate Manual Vacuum**
If you need to **urgently remove dead tuples**, manually run:
```sql
VACUUM ANALYZE my_large_table;
```
Or, for a **full rebuild (table lock required)**:
```sql
VACUUM FULL my_large_table;
```
**Warning:** `VACUUM FULL` **locks the table**, making it unavailable for writes.

---

## **7. Use `pg_repack` for Online Table Repacking**
If `VACUUM FULL` is too disruptive, use **`pg_repack`**:
```bash
pg_repack -h mydbhost -U myuser -d mydatabase -t my_large_table
```
**Benefits:**
- **Rebuilds the table without locking it** (only a short lock at the end).
- **Reduces bloat by rewriting the table efficiently**.

---

## **8. Check Frozen Transaction IDs to Avoid Wraparound**
```sql
SELECT 
    datname, age(datfrozenxid) AS xid_age,
    setting::int AS autovacuum_freeze_max_age
FROM pg_database, pg_settings 
WHERE name = 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age'
ORDER BY xid_age DESC;
```
**Action Plan:**
- If `xid_age` is **approaching `autovacuum_freeze_max_age`** (default **200 million**), increase vacuum frequency.

---

## **9. Enable Logging to Debug Autovacuum**
To **log all autovacuum actions**, modify `postgresql.conf`:
```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET log_autovacuum_min_duration = 0;
SELECT pg_reload_conf();
```
- Logs every **autovacuum execution** in `postgresql.log`.
- Helps diagnose if **autovacuum is running too slowly or not at all**.

---

## **10. Check Index Bloat**
```sql
SELECT 
    schemaname, 
    relname AS index_name, 
    pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size(indexrelid)) AS index_size, 
    pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size(relid)) AS table_size, 
    (pg_relation_size(indexrelid)::numeric / pg_relation_size(relid)) AS index_to_table_ratio
FROM pg_stat_user_indexes 
WHERE pg_relation_size(relid) > 0
ORDER BY index_to_table_ratio DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
**Action Plan:**
- If `index_to_table_ratio > 1.0`, the **index is larger than the table itself** → Consider reindexing.
```sql
REINDEX TABLE my_large_table;
```

---

## **Summary**
✅ **Monitor Bloat** (`pgstattuple`, dead tuples count)  
✅ **Fine-Tune Autovacuum** (scale factor, cost delay, cost limit)  
✅ **Manually Vacuum Large Tables** if autovacuum is too slow  
✅ **Use `pg_repack`** instead of `VACUUM FULL` for large bloated tables  
✅ **Enable Logging** to diagnose vacuum performance

Here's a **summary and key takeaways** from the webinar on **Advanced Autovacuum Tuning & the pganalyze VACUUM Advisor**:

---

---

### **2. Key PostgreSQL Vacuum Statistics**
- **pg_stat_progress_vacuum**: Tracks active vacuum operations.
- **pg_stat_activity**: Shows active autovacuum workers.
- **Autovacuum Logs**: Crucial for diagnosing performance issues (AWS RDS defaults to logging every **10 seconds**).

---

### **3. Common Autovacuum Challenges**
#### **a) Bloat**
- **Bloat** occurs when deleted/updated rows are not reclaimed, causing excessive disk usage and slower queries.
- Solutions:
  - Adjust **autovacuum scale factor and threshold** settings.
  - Use tools like `pg_stat_tuple` to estimate bloat accurately.
  - Consider **pg_repack** or **VACUUM FULL** when necessary.

#### **b) XMIN Horizon & Dead Tuples Not Being Removed**
- **XMIN Horizon (Removable Cutoff)**: Controls how many dead tuples autovacuum can clean.
- **Causes of blocked autovacuum:**
  - **Long-running transactions** (open transactions block vacuum from reclaiming space).
  - **Stale replication slots** (prevent vacuum from marking tuples as removable).
  - **Prepared transactions** (can delay tuple cleanup).
  - **Long-running queries on replicas** (if `hot_standby_feedback` is enabled).
- **Solution:** Identify and remove stale replication slots (`pg_drop_replication_slot`), and manage long transactions.

#### **c) Freezing & Transaction Wraparound**
- **PostgreSQL requires freezing old transaction IDs (XIDs) to prevent wraparound failure.**
- Key settings:
  - `autovacuum_freeze_max_age`: When to trigger aggressive freezing.
  - `vacuum_freeze_min_age`: Controls when vacuum marks XIDs as frozen.
- **Prevention:** Regularly monitor **XID age** to avoid emergency database shutdown.

#### **d) Autovacuum Performance & Worker Tuning**
- **Autovacuum workers** can become a bottleneck if there aren’t enough processes.
- Solutions:
  - Adjust `autovacuum_max_workers` if all workers are always in use.
  - Tune `autovacuum_cost_limit` and `autovacuum_cost_delay` for better performance.
  - Monitor **skipped autovacuums** due to table locks.

---

### **4. Features of the pganalyze VACUUM Advisor**
- **Bloat Estimation**: Provides insights based on **column statistics** without expensive queries.
- **XMIN Horizon Alerts**: Notifies when stale replication slots or long transactions are blocking vacuum.
- **Transaction Freezing Monitoring**: Tracks XID wraparound risk.
- **Autovacuum Performance Dashboard**:
  - Worker utilization insights.
  - Detects autovacuum conflicts with table locks.

---

### **5. Best Practices for Tuning Autovacuum**
1. **Enable autovacuum logging** (`log_autovacuum_min_duration = 0` recommended).
2. **Monitor XID wraparound risk** and prioritize freezing when necessary.
3. **Tune per-table autovacuum settings** (`autovacuum_vacuum_threshold`, `autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor`).
4. **Regularly clean up stale replication slots** to prevent XMIN Horizon blocking.
5. **Check for skipped autovacuums** due to table locks and adjust accordingly.
6. **Use pg_repack** when bloat becomes excessive (instead of `VACUUM FULL`).

Amazon **Aurora PostgreSQL handles `autovacuum` similarly to standard PostgreSQL**, but with **key differences and optimizations** due to Aurora's cloud-native architecture.

Here's a breakdown:

---

### ✅ **Aurora PostgreSQL and Autovacuum: Overview**

| Feature                      | Aurora PostgreSQL Behavior                                                                                         |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Autovacuum Daemon**        | **Enabled by default**, just like standard PostgreSQL                                                              |
| **Configuration Parameters** | Tunable via **DB parameter groups**                                                                                |
| **VACUUM and ANALYZE**       | Both are supported and function the same way                                                                       |
| **Storage Behavior**         | Vacuumed tuples are not reused until Aurora storage compaction processes reclaim space                             |
| **Performance Optimization** | Aurora uses **distributed storage** — so VACUUM doesn’t write to local disk, but can still incur I/O and CPU usage |
| **Crash Recovery & WAL**     | Aurora handles WAL differently, but autovacuum still generates WAL records when needed                             |

---

### 🔄 **What's the Same as Standard PostgreSQL**

* Autovacuum removes **dead tuples** and **bloat** to:

  * Prevent transaction ID wraparound
  * Maintain index and table efficiency
* You still configure:

  * `autovacuum_vacuum_threshold`
  * `autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor`
  * `autovacuum_naptime`
  * `autovacuum_max_workers`
* Manual `VACUUM`, `ANALYZE`, `VACUUM FULL` are supported

---

### ⚙️ **Aurora-Specific Considerations**

#### 1. **Aurora Storage Model**

* Aurora does not store data locally; it's **log-based and distributed** across multiple storage nodes.
* Dead tuples are not “cleaned up” on a local file — they exist until **Aurora’s background compaction** reclaims them at the segment level.
* Autovacuum still triggers the usual tuple pruning and hint bit setting, but reclaiming space is **logically deferred** to Aurora’s engine.

#### 2. **WAL Handling**

* Aurora uses a **log-only write model** — WAL is sent to storage nodes.
* This reduces **checkpoint overhead**, but autovacuum **still generates WAL** for updates and page visibility changes (e.g., hint bits), although more efficiently.

#### 3. **Monitoring Autovacuum**

Use standard PostgreSQL views:

```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_stat_all_tables WHERE n_dead_tup > 0;
SELECT * FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE query LIKE '%autovacuum%';
```

Also use **Amazon RDS Performance Insights** or **CloudWatch metrics** for CPU spikes related to autovacuum.

---

### 📌 **Tips for Managing Autovacuum in Aurora**

1. **Monitor Dead Tuples**:

   ```sql
   SELECT relname, n_dead_tup FROM pg_stat_user_tables WHERE n_dead_tup > 1000;
   ```

2. **Tune Autovacuum Settings** if you have large/busy tables:

   * Increase `autovacuum_max_workers`
   * Lower `autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor` for frequently updated tables

3. **Avoid Manual VACUUM FULL**:

   * It rewrites the entire table — expensive and blocks writes.
   * Use with caution in production, just like in standard PostgreSQL.

4. **Use pg\_stat\_all\_tables** to understand vacuum frequency and dead row accumulation.

---

### 🧠 Summary

> **Aurora PostgreSQL handles autovacuum much like standard PostgreSQL**, but because storage is **remote, log-based, and multi-AZ**, **physical cleanup is abstracted** into Aurora's engine. You still benefit from autovacuum's role in **XID wraparound prevention** and **query performance**, but **space reclaim is asynchronous and backend-managed.**

---

Let me know if you’d like a tuning recommendation for high-write Aurora workloads or help analyzing autovacuum logs.

### 🔁 What is a **Replication Slot** in PostgreSQL?

A **replication slot** is a **mechanism in PostgreSQL** that ensures the **WAL (Write-Ahead Log)** required by a **replica or client** is **retained** on the primary server **until it's confirmed as consumed**.

---

### ✅ **Why Replication Slots Are Used**

Replication slots prevent:

* **WAL loss** before replicas have read them.
* **Breakage of logical or physical replication** due to missing WAL files.

---

### 📦 Types of Replication Slots

| Type         | Purpose                                              | Used By                                            |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Physical** | Keeps WAL for streaming replication                  | Standby servers (binary replica)                   |
| **Logical**  | Streams **logical changes** (e.g., INSERTs, UPDATEs) | Logical decoding clients (e.g., Debezium, AWS DMS) |

---

### 🧠 **How It Works (Simplified)**

1. A replication slot is **created** using:

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM pg_create_physical_replication_slot('replica_slot');
   -- or for logical
   SELECT * FROM pg_create_logical_replication_slot('slot_name', 'pgoutput');
   ```

2. PostgreSQL starts **tracking the oldest WAL LSN (Log Sequence Number)** required by the slot.

3. WAL files are **retained on disk** until:

   * The client **acknowledges receipt**, and
   * PostgreSQL marks that position as safe to remove.

4. Even if the client disconnects, WAL is **not deleted**.

---

### 📉 What Happens If You Don't Use a Replication Slot?

* If the replica **lags** and **WAL files are recycled**, it may **fail to catch up** and require a **rebuild**.
* With replication slots, the primary **keeps enough WAL** to safely resume replication.

### ⚠️ Important Considerations

| Risk / Caution                 | Description                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Disk Bloat (WAL Retention)** | If the replica or client **stops consuming**, the primary **keeps all WAL**, leading to **disk usage growth**.       |
| **Monitoring is essential**    | Use `pg_replication_slots` to monitor lag and status.                                                                |
| **Aurora PostgreSQL note**     | Aurora **does not support physical replication slots**, but **supports logical slots** for use with DMS or Debezium. |

---

### 🔍 Check Existing Slots

```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_replication_slots;
```

### 💡 Summary

> A **replication slot** ensures WAL files are kept until they are consumed by a replica or CDC client. It's crucial for **streaming replication**, **logical decoding**, and tools like **AWS DMS**, but requires careful **monitoring to avoid disk bloat**.

## 🔧 **1. Global Autovacuum Configuration (postgresql.conf)**

| Parameter                             | Default                        | Purpose                                             |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `autovacuum`                          | `on`                           | Enables the autovacuum daemon                       |
| `autovacuum_naptime`                  | `1min`                         | Time between autovacuum runs                        |
| `autovacuum_max_workers`              | `3`                            | Max concurrent autovacuum processes                 |
| `autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit`        | `-1` (use `vacuum_cost_limit`) | Work budget for each autovacuum                     |
| `autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay`        | `20ms`                         | Delay between vacuum steps                          |
| `autovacuum_freeze_max_age`           | `200 million`                  | Force vacuum to avoid XID wraparound                |
| `autovacuum_multixact_freeze_max_age` | `400 million`                  | Same as above for multi-transaction IDs             |
| `autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor`      | `0.2`                          | % of row updates/deletes to trigger vacuum          |
| `autovacuum_vacuum_threshold`         | `50`                           | Base number of row changes before vacuum            |
| `autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor`     | `0.1`                          | % of row inserts/updates/deletes to trigger analyze |
| `autovacuum_analyze_threshold`        | `50`                           | Base number of row changes before analyze           |

## 🧠 **2. How Vacuum is Triggered**

For a table to be vacuumed:

```text
updates + deletes ≥ (scale_factor * reltuples) + threshold
```

**Example:**
For a 1 million row table with defaults:

```text
0.2 * 1,000,000 + 50 = 200,050 changes needed
```

🔸 For large tables, this may delay vacuum → consider reducing `scale_factor`.

---

## ✅ **3. Recommended Tuning Examples**

### 🔹 High-Update OLTP System

```conf
autovacuum_max_workers = 10
autovacuum_naptime = 10s
autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay = 5ms
autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit = 1000
autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor = 0.05
autovacuum_vacuum_threshold = 50
autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor = 0.02
```

### 🔹 Append-Only (Insert-heavy) System

* Focus on **analyze** rather than vacuum

```conf
autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor = 0.01
autovacuum_analyze_threshold = 50
```

---

## 🧩 **4. Per-Table Tuning**

Use `ALTER TABLE` to override global defaults:

```sql
ALTER TABLE big_table
  SET (autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor = 0.01,
       autovacuum_vacuum_threshold = 100,
       autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor = 0.005);
```

---

## 🧪 **5. Monitoring Autovacuum**

Query for vacuum stats:

```sql
SELECT relname, n_tup_ins, n_tup_upd, n_tup_del, n_dead_tup, last_autovacuum
FROM pg_stat_user_tables
ORDER BY n_dead_tup DESC;
```

Check age (to prevent wraparound):

```sql
SELECT datname, age(datfrozenxid)
FROM pg_database
ORDER BY age(datfrozenxid) DESC;
```

---

## ❗ **6. Tips & Best Practices**

* Always monitor **dead tuples** and **XID age**.
* Don’t set `autovacuum = off` unless you know what you're doing.
* Use **pg\_stat\_activity** to detect slow autovacuums.
* Consider using **parallel workers**, higher cost limits for large tables.
* Avoid wraparound: monitor databases approaching **2.1 billion XIDs**.
