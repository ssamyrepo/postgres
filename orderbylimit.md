### üî• 1. **Top 10 Dangerous PostgreSQL Issues (Postgres FM Recap)**

| #  | Issue                       | Key Insight                                                                                                       |
| -- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1  | Heavy Lock Contention       | Schema changes (e.g., `ALTER TABLE`) can block other queries. Use `lock_timeout` and `SKIP LOCKED` for queues.    |
| 2  | Bloat & Index Maintenance   | Frequent updates can cause bloat. Use `pgstattuple`, `pg_stat_all_indexes`, and `REINDEX CONCURRENTLY`.           |
| 3  | Lightweight Lock Contention | Caused by excessive active queries, poor schema design, or too many partitions. Monitor shared buffer contention. |
| 4  | Transaction ID Wraparound   | Stay within 2B XIDs limit. Consider batching to reduce transaction count.                                         |
| 5  | Integer PK Limit            | Switch from `int` to `bigint` for primary keys to prevent 2.1B row limit.                                         |
| 6  | Replication Limits          | `wal_sender` is single-threaded; compression worsens performance. Can saturate CPU core.                          |
| 7  | Hard Limits                 | Includes max DB size, table size, column limits. Be aware when scaling.                                           |
| 8  | Data Loss                   | Happens due to accidental deletes or async replica failovers. Use sync replication for safety.                    |
| 9  | Poor HA Design              | Risk of split-brain with dual primaries. Use a reliable failover strategy.                                        |
| 10 | Corruption                  | Rare, but enable checksums and use tools like `amcheck`.                                                          |

### üöÄ 2. **Consulting Corner: 20,000x Performance Boost by Fixing ORDER BY LIMIT**

* **Issue:** A query with `ORDER BY col LIMIT 1` ignored a highly selective `WHERE` clause and chose a suboptimal plan due to index bias.
* **Symptoms:**

  * Slow query (\~2s), high buffer usage.
  * Removing `LIMIT` or increasing it to 10/100 rows resulted in **\~0.1ms execution** ‚Äî 20,000x faster.
* **Root Cause:** PostgreSQL planner chose the `ORDER BY` index instead of the more selective filter due to limit-based optimization.
* **Fixes:**

  1. **Remove LIMIT** ‚Äì Let app code filter top result after fetching.
  2. **Expression Trick** ‚Äì Alter `ORDER BY col` to `ORDER BY col + 0` or `col || ''` to bypass index.
  3. **Materialized CTE** ‚Äì Use a `WITH cte AS (...) SELECT * FROM cte LIMIT 1`.

| Feature                  | Benefit                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| üîÑ Export/Import Stats   | Use `pg_dump --section=statistics` to transfer query stats to lower environments for consistent plan testing. |
| ‚ö° Asynchronous I/O       | New `io_method` options: `sync`, `worker` (default), `io_uring` (best performance, Linux only).               |
| üß™ Upgrade Improvements  | Stats preservation & job-based parallelism for `pg_upgrade`.                                                  |
| üìà More Explain Details  | Better diagnostics for query tuning.                                                                          |
| üßπ Enhanced VACUUM Stats | Helps monitor auto-vacuum more precisely.                                                                     |
| üÜï UUIDv7 Support        | Time-sortable UUIDs, good for PKs.                                                                            |
| ‚è© Skip Scan Optimization | Faster index-only scans in some use cases.                                                                    |

### üìö 4. **Other Notable Content**

* **Write-Ahead Logging (WAL):** Core to crash recovery, physical & logical replication.
* **Logical Replication:** Set up with `publication`, `subscription`, and replication slots. Better for filtered and multi-target replication.
* **CockroachDB to PostgreSQL Migration:** Driven by limitations in CockroachDB; improved flexibility and performance in Postgres.
* **FerretDB:** MongoDB-compatible interface over Postgres backend ‚Äî ideal for Mongo users transitioning to a SQL base.
* **Neon Acquired by Databricks:** Signals growing interest in serverless Postgres and modern data stack integrations.
