### High-Level Explanation of Locks and Wait Events

1. **Lock: transactionid** (`< 0.01`)
   - **What it is**: This wait event occurs when a transaction is waiting to acquire a lock on a specific transaction ID. This typically happens when multiple transactions try to access or modify the same row(s) concurrently, and PostgreSQL needs to ensure consistency (e.g., to prevent conflicts in updates or deletes).
   - **Why it happens**: Common in workloads with high concurrency, like `pgbench`’s TPC-B-like tests, where multiple clients update the same tables (e.g., `pgbench_accounts`).
   - **Impact**: Low impact here (`< 0.01` seconds), indicating minimal contention. In a `pgbench` run with 10 clients (`-c 10`), this suggests your workload isn’t heavily conflicting on specific rows.
   - **In your context**: The `pgbench` test on your RDS instance (`db.t3.medium`) is likely not pushing the database hard enough to cause significant transaction ID lock contention.

2. **LWLock: WALWrite** (`< 0.01`)
   - **What it is**: A lightweight lock (LWLock) on the Write-Ahead Log (WAL) write operation. The WAL is PostgreSQL’s mechanism for ensuring durability by logging changes before they are applied to the database. This lock is acquired when a transaction needs to write to the WAL buffer.
   - **Why it happens**: Occurs during commits or updates in write-heavy workloads, as `pgbench` generates WAL activity for transactions (e.g., updates to `pgbench_accounts`).
   - **Impact**: Minimal (`< 0.01` seconds), suggesting WAL writes are not a bottleneck. On RDS, WAL performance depends on the instance’s IOPS and storage type (e.g., your 100 GB allocated storage).
   - **In your context**: Your `pgbench` workload is light, and the RDS instance’s storage (likely gp2 or gp3) is handling WAL writes efficiently.

3. **CPU** (`< 0.01`)
   - **What it is**: Indicates the database is waiting on CPU resources, meaning queries are compute-bound rather than I/O- or lock-bound. This includes query parsing, planning, or execution.
   - **Why it happens**: Common in `pgbench` runs with simple queries (like SELECTs or UPDATEs) that require CPU cycles for processing.
   - **Impact**: Negligible (`< 0.01` seconds), indicating your `db.t3.medium` instance (2 vCPUs) is not CPU-constrained for this workload.
   - **In your context**: The `pgbench` test with 10 clients and 2 threads (`-j 2`) is not overloading the CPU, which is expected for a small-scale benchmark.

4. **IO: WALSync** (`< 0.01`)
   - **What it is**: A wait event where PostgreSQL is waiting for WAL data to be synchronized to disk (fsync). This ensures transaction durability by confirming WAL logs are written to persistent storage.
   - **Why it happens**: Occurs during transaction commits, especially in write-heavy workloads like `pgbench`. On RDS, this depends on the underlying storage performance.
   - **Impact**: Minimal (`< 0.01` seconds), indicating fast disk syncs. Your RDS instance’s storage configuration is handling WAL syncs efficiently.
   - **In your context**: The low wait time suggests your RDS instance’s IOPS and storage type are sufficient for the `pgbench` workload.

5. **Client: ClientRead** (`< 0.01`)
   - **What it is**: Indicates the database is waiting for the client (e.g., `pgbench`) to read data sent by the server. This happens when the client application is slow to process query results.
   - **Why it happens**: Common in `pgbench` when the client (running on your EC2 instance) is processing query results or network latency exists between the EC2 (`10.0.11.150`) and RDS (`10.0.33.133`) instances.
   - **Impact**: Negligible (`< 0.01` seconds), suggesting the EC2 instance and network are keeping up with the database’s output.
   - **In your context**: Since both EC2 and RDS are in the same VPC (`us-east-1`), network latency is low, and the EC2 instance (`ip-10-0-11-150`) is handling client reads efficiently.

6. **IO: DataFileRead** (`< 0.01`)
   - **What it is**: Occurs when PostgreSQL is waiting to read data from database files (e.g., table or index pages) from disk into memory.
   - **Why it happens**: Common in read-heavy or mixed workloads like `pgbench`, especially for SELECTs or index scans on tables like `pgbench_accounts`.
   - **Impact**: Minimal (`< 0.01` seconds), indicating fast disk I/O. Your RDS instance’s storage (100 GB, likely gp2/gp3) is performing well.
   - **In your context**: The `pgbench` workload is small (default scaling factor), so data likely fits in memory, reducing I/O waits.

7. **Lock: tuple** (`< 0.01`)
   - **What it is**: A wait event where a transaction is waiting to acquire a lock on a specific tuple (row) in a table, typically during updates or deletes.
   - **Why it happens**: Occurs in `pgbench` when multiple clients try to update the same row (e.g., in `pgbench_accounts` or `pgbench_branches`), causing row-level locking.
   - **Impact**: Low (`< 0.01` seconds), indicating minimal row-level contention in your workload.
   - **In your context**: The `pgbench` test with 10 clients isn’t generating significant tuple-level conflicts, likely due to the small dataset or low contention.

8. **Timeout: VacuumTruncate** (`< 0.01`)
   - **What it is**: A wait event related to PostgreSQL’s `VACUUM` process, specifically when it’s waiting to truncate empty pages at the end of a table. This occurs during autovacuum or manual `VACUUM` operations.
   - **Why it happens**: In `pgbench`, frequent updates/deletes can create dead tuples, triggering autovacuum. This wait indicates the vacuum process is waiting to acquire a lock to truncate table space.
   - **Impact**: Negligible (`< 0.01` seconds), suggesting autovacuum is running efficiently and not significantly impacting performance.
   - **In your context**: On RDS, autovacuum is managed automatically. The low wait time indicates it’s not a bottleneck for your `pgbench` workload.

9. **IO: WALWrite** (`< 0.01`)
   - **What it is**: A wait event (not an LWLock) where PostgreSQL is waiting to write WAL data to disk (distinct from `WALSync`, which is about syncing). This involves writing transaction logs to the WAL buffer.
   - **Why it happens**: Common in write-heavy workloads like `pgbench`, where transactions generate WAL entries.
   - **Impact**: Minimal (`< 0.01` seconds), indicating fast WAL writes, consistent with the `LWLock:WALWrite` observation.
   - **In your context**: The RDS instance’s storage is handling WAL writes efficiently for your workload.

### High-Level Summary
- **Overall Performance**: All wait events have durations `< 0.01` seconds, indicating no significant bottlenecks in your `pgbench` run. The `db.t3.medium` RDS instance (2 vCPUs, 100 GB storage) is handling the workload (10 clients, 2 threads, 1000 transactions each) effectively.
- **Key Observations**:
  - **Low Contention**: Minimal waits on `Lock:transactionid` and `Lock:tuple` suggest the `pgbench` workload has low row-level or transaction-level conflicts, typical for a small-scale test.
  - **Efficient I/O**: `IO:WALWrite`, `IO:WALSync`, and `IO:DataFileRead` waits are negligible, indicating the RDS storage (likely gp2/gp3) is performing well.
  - **Low CPU Usage**: The `CPU` wait is minimal, showing the instance isn’t compute-bound.
  - **Client and Network**: `Client:ClientRead` is low, confirming the EC2 instance and VPC network are handling communication efficiently.
  - **Autovacuum**: `Timeout:VacuumTruncate` is minimal, indicating autovacuum is running smoothly on RDS.
- **Context with Your Setup**: The `pgbench` run on `pglab` database (`rds-pg-labs.cj2s8sqw4bta.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com`) is a light workload. The low wait times align with the small instance size (`db.t3.medium`) and modest `pgbench` parameters (`-c 10 -j 2 -t 1000`).

### Recommendations
1. **Increase Workload for Meaningful Benchmarks**:
   - The low wait times suggest the workload is too light to stress the RDS instance. Increase the scaling factor (`-s`) or number of clients (`-c`) in `pgbench`:
     ```bash
     pgbench -i -s 10 -h $PGHOST -p $DBPORT -U $PGUSER -d pglab "sslmode=$PGSSLMODE sslrootcert=$PGSSLROOTCERT"
     pgbench -h $PGHOST -p $DBPORT -U $PGUSER -d pglab -c 50 -j 4 -t 10000 "sslmode=$PGSSLMODE sslrootcert=$PGSSLROOTCERT"
     ```
     - `-s 10`: Increases dataset size (10x default).
     - `-c 50 -j 4`: More clients and threads to stress the system.

2. **Monitor Wait Events**:
   - Use `pg_stat_activity` or `pg_wait_sampling` to monitor wait events during `pgbench`:
     ```bash
     psql "host=$PGHOST port=$DBPORT user=$PGUSER password=$PGPASSWORD dbname=pglab sslmode=$PGSSLMODE sslrootcert=$PGSSLROOTCERT" -c "SELECT wait_event_type, wait_event, count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE wait_event IS NOT NULL GROUP BY wait_event_type, wait_event;"
     ```
   - On RDS, enable Performance Insights to analyze wait events.

3. **Optimize RDS**:
   - If you scale up the workload, consider upgrading to a larger instance (e.g., `db.m5.large`) or increasing IOPS if `IO:WALSync` or `IO:DataFileRead` waits increase.
   - Check RDS parameter group (`default.postgres17`) for settings like `wal_buffers` or `checkpoint_timeout` if WAL-related waits grow.

4. **Verify SSL and Password**:
   - Previous SSL issues (`certificate verify failed`) suggest using `sslmode=require` if `verify-full` continues to fail:
     ```bash
     export PGSSLMODE=require
     sed -i 's/export PGSSLMODE=verify-full/export PGSSLMODE=require/' /home/ubuntu/.bashrc
     source /home/ubuntu/.bashrc
     ```
   - Confirm the password (`Goodwin3889`) is correct, or retrieve it from the secret ARN (from your earlier script):
     ```bash
     aws secretsmanager get-secret-value --secret-id "<SECRET_ARN>" --region us-east-1 --query SecretString --output text
