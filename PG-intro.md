### **History of PostgreSQL**
- Originally developed by **Michael Stonebraker** at the University of California, Berkeley, in **1985**.
- Initially called **POSTGRES**, referencing the older **Ingres database**.
- Renamed to **PostgreSQL** in **1996** to reflect its support for **SQL**.
- Maintained by a **global development team** that continuously improves the database.

### **Architecture**
PostgreSQL follows a **client-server model** with the following components:

#### **Memory Areas**
1. **Shared Buffers**:
   - Caches data to minimize disk I/O.
   - Stores frequently accessed data for faster retrieval.

2. **WAL Buffers**:
   - Temporarily stores changes before writing them to WAL files.
   - Ensures data durability and supports backup/recovery.

3. **Work Memory**:
   - Used for sorting, hash joins, and temporary operations.
   - Default size is **4 MB**.

4. **Maintenance Work Memory**:
   - Used for maintenance tasks like **VACUUM** and **CREATE INDEX**.

5. **Temporary Buffers**:
   - Used for temporary tables.

#### **Background Processes**
1. **Postmaster**:
   - The main process that initializes memory, starts background processes, and handles client connections.

2. **Logger**:
   - Writes error messages to log files.

3. **Checkpointer**:
   - Periodically flushes dirty buffers to data files to maintain consistency.

4. **Background Writer**:
   - Writes dirty buffers to data files to reduce checkpoint workload.

5. **WAL Writer**:
   - Writes data from WAL buffers to WAL files.

6. **Autovacuum Launcher**:
   - Automatically reclaims unused space from tables after inserts, updates, and deletes.

7. **Archiver**:
   - Archives WAL files for point-in-time recovery.

8. **Stats Collector**:
   - Collects statistical information about database usage.

---

### **Data Flow**
1. A client sends a request to the PostgreSQL server.
2. The **Postmaster** process checks permissions and spawns a PostgreSQL process.
3. Data is read from **data files** into **shared buffers**.
4. The PostgreSQL process retrieves data from shared buffers and returns it to the client.
5. For write operations, changes are first written to **WAL buffers** and then to **WAL files**.
6. On commit, changes are permanently saved to **data files**.

---

### **System Commands**
- **`systemctl status postgresql-12`**:
  - Displays the status of PostgreSQL processes, including the **Postmaster**, **Logger**, **Checkpointer**, **Background Writer**, **WAL Writer**, **Autovacuum Launcher**, and **Stats Collector**.

     - **Write-Ahead Logging (WAL)**: Ensures data integrity and supports point-in-time recovery.
     - **International Character Support**: Supports various character sets and large database sizes.
     - **Licensing**: PostgreSQL is open-source and free, unlike proprietary databases like Oracle.

### 2. **Installation of PostgreSQL**
   - **On Windows**: The video walks through downloading the PostgreSQL installer, setting up the database, and accessing it via the command line and PGAdmin4.
   - **On Linux**: The installation process involves using the Yum repository, initializing the database, and starting the PostgreSQL service. The video also covers creating a new user and role.

### 3. **PostgreSQL Architecture**
   - **Client-Server Model**: PostgreSQL operates on a client-server model where the client sends requests to the PostgreSQL server.
   - **Memory Areas**: 
     - **Shared Buffers**: Caches data to minimize disk I/O.
     - **WAL Buffers**: Temporarily stores changes before writing them to WAL files.
     - **Work Memory**: Used for sorting and temporary operations.
   - **Background Processes**: 
     - **Postmaster**: The main process that manages connections and spawns other processes.
     - **Background Writer**: Writes dirty buffers to disk.
     - **WAL Writer**: Writes WAL buffers to WAL files.
     - **Auto Vacuum**: Cleans up dead tuples to free up space.
     - **Archiver**: Archives WAL files for backup and recovery.

### 4. **Moving Data Directory**
   - **Why Move Data Directory?**: Over time, the storage allocated to the data directory may get exhausted, requiring either extending the storage or moving the data files to a new location.
   - **Steps to Move Data Directory**:
     1. Identify the current data directory location.
     2. Stop the PostgreSQL service.
     3. Copy the data files to the new location.
     4. Update the `postgresql.conf` file to point to the new data directory.
     5. Restart the PostgreSQL service and verify the new location.

### 5. **Enabling Remote Access**
   - **Default Behavior**: By default, PostgreSQL does not allow remote connections.
   - **Steps to Enable Remote Access**:
     1. Modify the `pg_hba.conf` file to allow connections from remote IP addresses.
     2. Update the `postgresql.conf` file to listen on the server's IP address instead of localhost.
     3. Restart the PostgreSQL service and test the remote connection.

### 6. **Password Files**
   - **What is a Password File?**: A password file (`.pgpass` on Linux) stores passwords for PostgreSQL connections, allowing users to avoid entering passwords manually.
   - **Usage**: Password files are useful for automation but can pose security risks if not properly secured.
   - **Location**: On Linux, it is located in the home directory of the PostgreSQL user. On Windows, it is in the `AppData\PostgreSQL` directory.

### 7. **PostgreSQL Configuration File (`postgresql.conf`)**
   - **What is `postgresql.conf`?**: The main configuration file for PostgreSQL, containing parameters that control the behavior of the database server.
   - **Key Parameters**:
     - **Listen Addresses**: Controls which IP addresses the server listens on.
     - **Max Connections**: Limits the number of concurrent connections.
     - **Shared Buffers**: Allocates memory for caching data.
     - **WAL Settings**: Controls WAL file size and archiving.
   - **Modifying Parameters**: Parameters can be modified using the `ALTER SYSTEM` command or by editing the `postgresql.conf` file directly.

### 8. **Tablespaces**
   - **What is a Tablespace?**: A tablespace is a storage location where PostgreSQL stores data files. It maps a logical name to a physical location on the disk.
   - **Default Tablespaces**: PostgreSQL creates two default tablespaces: `pg_default` for user data and `pg_global` for global data.
   - **Creating New Tablespaces**: New tablespaces can be created to manage storage more efficiently, especially when dealing with large databases or high-performance storage.

### 9. **Schemas**
   - **What is a Schema?**: A schema is a logical container within a database that can hold tables, views, functions, and other objects.
   - **Public Schema**: By default, every database has a `public` schema where all objects are created unless specified otherwise.
   - **Search Path**: The search path determines the order in which PostgreSQL looks for objects in schemas. By default, it looks in the `public` schema.

### 10. **Roles and Users**
   - **Roles vs. Users**: In PostgreSQL, a role can be a user or a group of users. A user is essentially a role with login permissions.
   - **Creating Roles**: Roles can be created with specific permissions, such as read-only or read-write access to certain tables or schemas.
   - **Granting Privileges**: Privileges can be granted to roles, which can then be assigned to users.

### 11. **Vacuum and Auto Vacuum**
   - **What is Vacuuming?**: Vacuuming is the process of removing dead tuples (rows that are no longer needed) from tables and indexes.
   - **Auto Vacuum**: PostgreSQL automatically runs vacuuming processes to maintain database performance. However, manual vacuuming may be required for large tables or specific maintenance tasks.
   - **Vacuum Full**: A more aggressive form of vacuuming that reclaims storage space but requires a full table lock.

### 12. **Write-Ahead Logging (WAL)**
   - **What is WAL?**: WAL is a method used by PostgreSQL to ensure data integrity. All changes to the database are first written to WAL files before being applied to the actual data files.
   - **Archiving WAL Files**: WAL files can be archived to a separate location for backup and recovery purposes.
   - **WAL Levels**: PostgreSQL supports different WAL levels, such as `minimal`, `replica`, and `logical`, which control the amount of information logged.

### 13. **Logical Replication**
   - **What is Logical Replication?**: Logical replication allows you to replicate data changes from one database to another, even across different versions or platforms.
   - **Publisher and Subscriber**: The publisher is the source database where changes occur, and the subscriber is the target database that receives those changes.
   - **Use Cases**: Logical replication is useful for data warehousing, consolidating data from multiple databases, and replicating data between different PostgreSQL versions.

### 14. **Backup and Restore**
   - **Backup Utilities**: PostgreSQL provides several utilities for backup, including `pg_dump`, `pg_dumpall`, and `pg_basebackup`.
   - **Backup Formats**: Backups can be taken in plain text, custom, tar, or directory formats.
   - **Restoration**: Backups can be restored using `pg_restore` for non-text formats or `psql` for plain text backups.

### 15. **Upgrading PostgreSQL**
   - **PG Upgrade Utility**: The `pg_upgrade` utility allows you to upgrade PostgreSQL from an older version to a newer version without requiring a full dump and restore.
   - **Steps to Upgrade**:
     1. Install the new version of PostgreSQL.
     2. Initialize the new cluster.
     3. Stop both the old and new PostgreSQL instances.
     4. Run the `pg_upgrade` utility to migrate data from the old cluster to the new one.
     5. Start the new cluster and verify the upgrade.

### 16. **PG Base Backup**
   - **What is PG Base Backup?**: `pg_basebackup` is a utility used to take a binary backup of a running PostgreSQL cluster. It is useful for creating standby databases or performing point-in-time recovery.
   - **Usage**: `pg_basebackup` can be used to create a full backup of the database cluster, including WAL files, which are necessary for recovery.

### 17. **PG Repack**
   - **What is PG Repack?**: `pg_repack` is a utility used to rebuild PostgreSQL tables and indexes online, removing bloat and reclaiming storage space.
   - **Advantages**: Unlike vacuuming, `pg_repack` can rebuild tables and indexes without requiring a full table lock, making it suitable for use in production environments.

### 18. **Routine Maintenance**
   - **Vacuuming**: Regularly vacuuming tables and indexes to remove dead tuples and improve performance.
   - **Analyzing**: Updating table statistics to help the query planner generate efficient execution plans.
   - **Reindexing**: Rebuilding indexes to remove fragmentation and improve performance.
   - **Clustering**: Physically reordering table data based on an index to improve query performance.

### 19. **Logical Replication Demo**
   - **Setup**: The demo shows how to set up logical replication between two PostgreSQL instances, one acting as the publisher and the other as the subscriber.
   - **Steps**:
     1. Configure the publisher by updating `postgresql.conf` and `pg_hba.conf`.
     2. Create a publication on the publisher.
     3. Create a subscription on the subscriber.
     4. Test the replication by inserting data on the publisher and verifying it on the subscriber.

### 20. **Backup and Restore Demo**
   - **Backup**: The demo shows how to use `pg_dump` to take a backup of a database and `pg_basebackup` to take a full cluster backup.
   - **Restore**: The demo also covers restoring a database from a backup using `pg_restore` and `psql`.

### 21. **PG Upgrade Demo**
   - **Upgrade Process**: The demo walks through upgrading a PostgreSQL instance from version 10 to version 12 using the `pg_upgrade` utility.
   - **Verification**: After the upgrade, the demo shows how to verify that the data has been successfully migrated to the new version.

### 22. **PG Repack Demo**
   - **Installation**: The demo shows how to install the `pg_repack` extension and enable it in a database.
   - **Usage**: The demo demonstrates how to use `pg_repack` to rebuild tables and indexes online, removing bloat and improving performance.
